<p>I am from Iran. I was born and raised in Tehran, the capital of Iran. It is a metropolitan city full of amusement, and it has wonderful nightlife.</p>
<p>I have a Master of Science in Electrical Control engineering. I love studying and learning new skills. I am trying to improve myself in any aspect that I can every day.</p>
<p>I am a fan of art, especially painting and photography, and I want to buy a professional camera in near future.</p>
<p>I love nature, I used to go mountain climbing every week, I love the sea, it feels me the ultimate relaxation when I am by the sea. One of my favorite hobbies is ecotourism.</p>
<p>I have Karate black belt, but I left this sport as I went to university and I was very busy continuing that. I love swimming, I do it whenever I have time and I really enjoy doing it in the sea.</p>
